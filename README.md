# Usage

To use this quiz:

### Existing virtualenv

If your project is already in an existing python3 virtualenv first install django by running

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
And then run the project with :

    $ python manage.py runserver
      
### No virtualenv

This assumes that `python3` is linked to valid installation of python 3 and that `pip` is installed and `pip3`is valid
for installing python 3 packages.

Installing inside virtualenv is recommended, however you can start your project without virtualenv too.

If you don't have django installed for python 3 then run:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
And then:

    $ python manage.py runserver
